How to run this code:
1: First of all setup the python environment.
2: Then set up the MySQL server to run the code on your local host.
3: Then create a database.
4: In the fourth step, download all six files. (app.py, index.html, edit_script.js, edit_recipe.html, script.js, and style.css)
5: Make a project folder(any name).
6: Then make sure to place the files in the following structure:
   The HTML and JavaScript files are typically stored in a folder called templates and static, respectively. Here's how you can organize your files:

I. Create a templates folder in your project directory.
II. Place the index.html and edit_recipe.html file inside the templates folder.
III. Create a static folder in your project directory.
IV. Inside the static folder, create three subfolders: images, css and js. (images folder will store the recipe images that you will upload on the website).
V. Place your CSS files (e.g., style.css) inside the css folder.
VI. Place your JavaScript files (e.g., edit_script.js, script.js) inside the js folder.
(Folder names: project, templates, static, images, css, js)
File names: app.py, index.html, edit_script.js, edit_recipe.html, script.js, and style.css)

7: Ensuring the Python, MYSQL and Database setup is complete. Run the Python file with the command "flask run" on your terminal.

I have used the following:
--> mysql  Ver 8.0.33-0ubuntu0.22.04.2 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))
--> Python 3.10.6
